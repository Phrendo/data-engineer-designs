# ADR 0004: Real-Time Notification System

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to design a scalable real-time notification delivery system capable of handling 5 million push notifications daily across multiple channels (push notifications, WebSocket, email, SMS) with GraphQL subscriptions for real-time web updates.

Key requirements:
- Handle 5M notifications/day (58 notifications/second average, 1000/second peak)
- Multi-channel delivery (push, WebSocket, email, SMS)
- GraphQL subscriptions for real-time web notifications
- User preference management and notification filtering
- Message prioritization and delivery guarantees
- Support for 100K concurrent WebSocket connections

## Decision

We will implement a notification system using Apache Kafka for message queuing, GraphQL subscriptions for real-time web delivery, and multiple channel integrations for comprehensive notification coverage.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput message streaming and queuing
- **GraphQL Server** with WebSocket subscriptions for real-time web notifications
- **FCM/APNS** integration for mobile push notifications
- **SMTP/Twilio** integration for email and SMS delivery
- **PostgreSQL** for user preferences and notification history
- **Redis** for WebSocket connection management and caching

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Message queuing with priority handling
- Publisher-subscriber pattern for multi-channel delivery
- Circuit breaker for external service integration
- Dead letter queues for failed delivery handling

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Real-time delivery capabilities with WebSocket connections
- Horizontal scalability through Kafka partitioning
- Multi-channel delivery ensuring message reach
- Flexible user preference management
- Message prioritization for critical notifications
- Comprehensive delivery tracking and analytics

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Increased complexity with multiple delivery channels
- Higher infrastructure costs for real-time connections
- Complex error handling across different channels
- Potential for message duplication across channels
- WebSocket connection management overhead

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Database Polling System**
- Rejected due to poor scalability and high latency
- Inefficient resource usage with constant polling
- Limited real-time capabilities

**Option B: Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- Rejected due to limited browser support and functionality
- One-way communication limiting interactive features
- Less efficient than WebSocket for bidirectional communication

**Option C: Third-party Service (Firebase, Pusher)**
- Rejected due to vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- Limited customization and control over delivery logic
- Potential data privacy and compliance issues

## Next Steps

1. **Core Infrastructure** (Week 1-3)
   - Deploy Kafka cluster for message queuing
   - Set up GraphQL server with WebSocket support
   - Implement basic notification engine

2. **Channel Integration** (Week 4-6)
   - Integrate FCM/APNS for mobile push notifications
   - Set up SMTP for email delivery
   - Implement Twilio integration for SMS

3. **Advanced Features** (Week 7-9)
   - Develop user preference management
   - Implement message prioritization
   - Add delivery tracking and analytics

4. **Scale and Monitor** (Week 10-12)
   - Performance optimization and load testing
   - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Security hardening and compliance validation
