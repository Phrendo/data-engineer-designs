# ADR 0009: Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to implement a circuit breaker pattern for a service mesh handling cascading failures across 50+ microservices, providing fault tolerance, system resilience, and preventing cascade failures during service outages.

Key requirements:
- Protect 50+ microservices from cascading failures
- Automatic failure detection and recovery
- Configurable failure thresholds and timeouts
- Integration with service mesh (Istio/Envoy)
- Comprehensive fallback strategies
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive circuit breaker pattern using Istio service mesh with Envoy proxies, combined with application-level circuit breakers and intelligent fallback mechanisms.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Istio Service Mesh** with Envoy proxy circuit breakers
- **Application-level circuit breakers** for fine-grained control
- **Adaptive thresholds** based on service health metrics
- **Fallback handlers** with cached responses and degraded functionality
- **Real-time monitoring** with Prometheus and Grafana
- **Automated recovery** with health checking

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Circuit breaker state machine (Closed/Open/Half-Open)
- Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- Timeout and retry patterns with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation with fallback responses

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Prevention of cascading failures across microservices
- Automatic failure detection and recovery
- Improved system resilience and availability
- Reduced blast radius during service outages
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Configurable thresholds for different service requirements

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Increased complexity in service communication
- Potential for false positives during temporary issues
- Additional latency for health checking and monitoring
- Complex configuration management across services
- Learning curve for development teams

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Application-level Only Circuit Breakers**
- Rejected due to inconsistent implementation across services
- Higher development effort for each service
- Limited integration with infrastructure-level monitoring

**Option B: Load Balancer-level Circuit Breaking**
- Rejected due to limited granularity and control
- Insufficient for complex fallback logic
- Poor integration with application-specific requirements

**Option C: Third-party Circuit Breaker Service**
- Rejected due to vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- Limited customization for specific business logic
- Additional network hop increasing latency
