# ADR 0008: Analytics Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to build a horizontally scalable analytics pipeline capable of aggregating user behavior data from 100+ million events daily, providing both real-time insights and batch processing capabilities for business intelligence and machine learning.

Key requirements:
- Process 100+ million events daily (1,157 events/second average)
- Real-time stream processing with <1 minute latency
- Batch processing for complex analytics and ML
- Support for multiple data sources and formats
- Data quality validation and cleansing
- Long-term data retention and archival

## Decision

We will implement a lambda architecture using Apache Kafka for streaming, Apache Spark for batch processing, and Apache Flink for real-time processing, with a data lake for storage.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput event streaming
- **Apache Spark** for large-scale batch processing
- **Apache Flink** for low-latency stream processing
- **Data Lake (S3/HDFS)** for raw event storage
- **Data Warehouse** for structured analytics data
- **Time Series Database** for real-time metrics

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Lambda architecture for both batch and stream processing
- Event sourcing for immutable data logs
- Schema evolution with backward compatibility
- Data partitioning for performance optimization

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Real-time analytics capabilities with sub-minute latency
- Scalable batch processing for complex analytics
- Flexible data lake storage for diverse data types
- Strong data quality framework ensuring accuracy
- Cost-effective long-term storage and archival
- Support for both operational and analytical workloads

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Increased complexity with multiple processing engines
- Higher infrastructure and operational costs
- Complex data pipeline orchestration and monitoring
- Potential for data inconsistency between batch and stream views
- Learning curve for multiple big data technologies

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Single Stream Processing (Kafka Streams only)**
- Rejected due to limitations in complex batch analytics
- Insufficient for machine learning workloads
- Poor performance for historical data processing

**Option B: Cloud-native Solution (AWS Kinesis + Glue)**
- Rejected due to vendor lock-in concerns
- Higher costs for large-scale processing
- Limited control over processing logic and optimization

**Option C: Traditional ETL with Scheduled Jobs**
- Rejected due to poor real-time capabilities
- Limited scalability for high-volume data
- Inflexible for diverse data processing requirements
