# ADR 0005: Feature Flag Service

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to build a high-performance feature flag service supporting A/B testing for 20 million users with sub-100ms latency requirements. The system must enable safe feature rollouts, experimentation, and real-time configuration changes without service restarts.

Key requirements:
- Support 20 million active users
- Sub-100ms p95 latency for flag evaluation
- 1 billion flag evaluations/day
- A/B testing framework with statistical analysis
- Real-time flag updates without service restart
- Multi-layer caching for performance optimization

## Decision

We will implement a feature flag service using multi-layer caching architecture with Redis, edge CDN caching, and local application caches, combined with a comprehensive A/B testing framework.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Multi-layer caching**: Local cache (1ms) → Redis (5ms) → Edge CDN (20ms) → Database (50ms)
- **PostgreSQL** for flag configuration and experiment data
- **Redis Cluster** for distributed caching and real-time updates
- **WebSocket** for real-time cache invalidation
- **Time Series Database** for experiment analytics
- **Statistical analysis engine** for A/B test results

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Multi-layer cache with TTL and version-based invalidation
- Event-driven cache invalidation
- Circuit breaker for external dependencies
- Bulk evaluation for performance optimization

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Sub-50ms flag evaluation latency through aggressive caching
- Real-time flag updates with WebSocket invalidation
- Comprehensive A/B testing with statistical significance
- Horizontal scalability through cache distribution
- High availability with multiple cache layers
- Flexible targeting and segmentation capabilities

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Complex cache invalidation logic across multiple layers
- Higher infrastructure costs for multi-layer caching
- Potential for cache inconsistency during updates
- Increased monitoring complexity for cache health
- Learning curve for statistical analysis features

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Database-only Solution**
- Rejected due to latency requirements (>100ms for complex evaluations)
- Limited scalability for high-frequency flag checks
- Poor performance under high load

**Option B: Single-layer Redis Cache**
- Rejected due to single point of failure concerns
- Limited performance optimization opportunities
- Higher latency during Redis cluster failures

**Option C: Third-party Service (LaunchDarkly, Split)**
- Rejected due to cost concerns at scale (20M users)
- Limited customization for complex business logic
- Vendor lock-in and data privacy concerns
