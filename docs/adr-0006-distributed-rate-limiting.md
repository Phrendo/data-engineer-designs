# ADR 0006: Distributed Rate Limiting System

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to design a distributed rate limiting system capable of protecting APIs from 1 million requests per second across multiple regions while maintaining consistent rate enforcement and providing DDoS protection capabilities.

Key requirements:
- Handle 1M requests/second across all regions
- Sub-5ms rate limiting decision time
- 99.9% rate limit enforcement accuracy
- Multi-region consistency with eventual convergence
- DDoS protection and attack mitigation
- Dynamic rate limit adjustment based on system load

## Decision

We will implement a distributed rate limiting system using Redis clusters with gossip protocol for cross-region synchronization, integrated with Nginx for high-performance request filtering.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Redis Cluster** for high-performance rate counter storage
- **Nginx with custom modules** for edge-level rate limiting
- **Gossip Protocol** for cross-region state synchronization
- **Multiple algorithms**: Sliding window, token bucket, and fixed window
- **Lua scripts** for atomic rate limit operations
- **Circuit breakers** for overload protection

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Distributed consensus with eventual consistency
- Multi-algorithm rate limiting for different use cases
- Circuit breaker pattern for cascade failure prevention
- Local-first decisions with global convergence

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- High-performance rate limiting with sub-5ms latency
- Consistent enforcement across multiple regions
- Flexible algorithm selection based on use case
- Automatic DDoS detection and mitigation
- Horizontal scalability through Redis clustering
- Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Complex synchronization logic across regions
- Eventual consistency may allow temporary limit breaches
- Higher infrastructure costs for multi-region deployment
- Increased operational complexity with distributed state
- Potential for split-brain scenarios during network partitions

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Centralized Rate Limiting**
- Rejected due to single point of failure and latency concerns
- Poor performance for global traffic distribution
- Limited scalability for high-throughput scenarios

**Option B: Application-level Rate Limiting**
- Rejected due to inconsistent enforcement across instances
- Higher latency and resource usage
- Difficult to coordinate across multiple services

**Option C: Cloud Provider Solutions (AWS API Gateway)**
- Rejected due to vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- Limited customization for complex rate limiting logic
- Poor performance for high-frequency requests
