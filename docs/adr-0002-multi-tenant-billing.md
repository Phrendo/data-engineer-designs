# ADR 0002: Multi-Tenant Billing System

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to design a comprehensive billing system that supports multiple monetization models (subscription, usage-based, and freemium) across multiple tenants with eventual consistency guarantees. The system must handle complex billing scenarios, multi-currency support, and compliance requirements while maintaining high availability and performance.

Key requirements:
- Support subscription, usage-based, and freemium billing models
- Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
- Eventually consistent billing calculations
- Multi-currency and tax compliance
- Integration with multiple payment gateways
- Dunning management for failed payments
- Real-time usage tracking and metering

## Decision

We will implement a microservices-based billing system using event-driven architecture with eventual consistency, leveraging PostgreSQL for transactional data and Redis for real-time caching.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Event-driven microservices** for billing engine, payment processing, and usage tracking
- **PostgreSQL** with tenant-based sharding for billing data
- **Redis** for real-time usage metering and caching
- **Apache Kafka** for event streaming and eventual consistency
- **Stripe** as primary payment gateway with PayPal backup

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Event sourcing for billing event history
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Outbox pattern for reliable event publishing
- Multi-tenancy with schema-per-tenant isolation

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Flexible billing model support enabling diverse monetization strategies
- Horizontal scalability through microservices and event-driven architecture
- Strong data isolation between tenants ensuring security and compliance
- Eventually consistent model allowing for high availability
- Multi-currency support enabling global expansion
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance and debugging

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Increased complexity due to distributed system challenges
- Eventual consistency may cause temporary billing discrepancies
- Higher operational overhead with multiple microservices
- Complex testing scenarios for distributed transactions
- Potential for increased latency in cross-service communications

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Monolithic Billing System**
- Rejected due to scalability limitations and deployment coupling
- Difficult to scale individual billing components independently
- Single point of failure for entire billing system

**Option B: Third-party Billing Platform (Stripe Billing)**
- Rejected due to limited customization capabilities
- Vendor lock-in and reduced control over billing logic
- Higher long-term costs and limited multi-tenancy support

**Option C: Synchronous Microservices with Strong Consistency**
- Rejected due to availability and performance concerns
- Increased latency and potential for cascade failures
- Difficult to achieve high availability across all services

## Next Steps

1. **Core Infrastructure** (Week 1-3)
   - Set up PostgreSQL clusters with tenant sharding
   - Deploy Kafka cluster for event streaming
   - Implement basic tenant management and isolation

2. **Billing Engine Development** (Week 4-6)
   - Develop subscription management service
   - Implement usage tracking and metering
   - Create invoice generation and payment processing

3. **Payment Integration** (Week 7-8)
   - Integrate Stripe and PayPal payment gateways
   - Implement dunning management workflows
   - Add multi-currency and tax calculation support

4. **Testing and Optimization** (Week 9-10)
   - Comprehensive integration testing
   - Performance optimization and load testing
   - Security audit and compliance validation
