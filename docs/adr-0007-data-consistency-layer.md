# ADR 0007: Data Consistency Layer

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to architect a data consistency layer for order processing across payment, inventory, and shipping microservices, ensuring ACID properties while handling distributed transaction challenges and maintaining system performance.

Key requirements:
- Ensure data consistency across payment, inventory, and shipping services
- Handle distributed transaction failures gracefully
- Maintain ACID properties where required
- Support both strong and eventual consistency models
- Provide compensation mechanisms for failed transactions
- Enable audit trails for compliance and debugging

## Decision

We will implement a data consistency layer using the Saga pattern for orchestration, event sourcing for audit trails, and the outbox pattern for reliable event publishing.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Saga Orchestrator** for distributed transaction management
- **Event Store** for immutable event logging and replay
- **Outbox Pattern** for reliable event publishing
- **Two-Phase Commit** for critical strong consistency requirements
- **Compensation Handlers** for rollback operations
- **PostgreSQL** with event sourcing for audit trails

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Saga pattern (both orchestration and choreography)
- Event sourcing for complete audit trails
- Outbox pattern for reliable messaging
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Circuit breaker for fault tolerance

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Reliable distributed transaction handling
- Complete audit trail for compliance requirements
- Flexible consistency models based on business needs
- Automatic compensation for failed transactions
- High availability through eventual consistency
- Scalable architecture with microservice independence

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Increased complexity in transaction management
- Eventual consistency may cause temporary data inconsistencies
- Higher development effort for compensation logic
- Complex testing scenarios for distributed failures
- Potential for increased latency in multi-step transactions

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Distributed Two-Phase Commit Only**
- Rejected due to availability and performance concerns
- Single point of failure with transaction coordinator
- Poor performance under high load and network latency

**Option B: Eventual Consistency Only**
- Rejected due to business requirements for strong consistency
- Insufficient for financial transactions requiring immediate consistency
- Complex reconciliation logic for critical operations

**Option C: Database-level Distributed Transactions**
- Rejected due to tight coupling between services
- Limited scalability and flexibility
- Vendor lock-in with specific database technologies

## Next Steps

1. **Foundation** (Week 1-4)
   - Implement event store infrastructure
   - Build basic saga orchestrator
   - Set up outbox pattern for reliable messaging

2. **Advanced Patterns** (Week 5-8)
   - Add two-phase commit for critical transactions
   - Implement compensation mechanisms
   - Build event sourcing optimization

3. **Production Ready** (Week 9-12)
   - Performance optimization and tuning
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Monitoring and alerting implementation
