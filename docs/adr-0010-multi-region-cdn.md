# ADR 0010: Multi-Region CDN

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to create a multi-region content delivery system with intelligent cache invalidation strategies for a global user base of 10 million users, providing low-latency content delivery, dynamic content optimization, and cost-effective global distribution.

Key requirements:
- Serve 10 million global users with <100ms latency
- 90%+ cache hit ratio for static content
- Real-time cache invalidation across all regions
- Dynamic content optimization (images, CSS, JS)
- DDoS protection and security features
- Cost optimization through intelligent caching

## Decision

We will implement a multi-region CDN using a combination of edge locations, regional caches, and intelligent cache management with real-time invalidation capabilities.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Global Edge Locations** (59 locations across 6 continents)
- **Regional Cache Clusters** for mid-tier caching
- **Origin Servers** with load balancing and failover
- **Real-time Cache Invalidation** with tag-based purging
- **Dynamic Content Optimization** for images and assets
- **Geographic Routing** for optimal edge selection

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Multi-tier caching with intelligent TTL management
- Tag-based cache invalidation for efficient purging
- Content optimization with dynamic image processing
- Geographic load balancing with health checking

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Global low-latency content delivery (<100ms for 95% of users)
- High cache efficiency reducing origin server load
- Real-time content updates across all regions
- Dynamic content optimization improving performance
- Comprehensive DDoS protection and security
- Cost optimization through intelligent caching strategies

**Negative trade-offs:**
- High infrastructure costs for global deployment
- Complex cache invalidation logic across regions
- Increased operational complexity with multiple regions
- Potential for cache inconsistency during updates
- Learning curve for advanced CDN features

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Single Cloud Provider CDN (CloudFront)**
- Rejected due to vendor lock-in and limited customization
- Higher costs for advanced features and global coverage
- Limited control over caching logic and optimization

**Option B: Multi-CDN Strategy**
- Rejected due to increased complexity and cost
- Difficult to manage consistent configuration
- Complex failover and traffic management

**Option C: Self-hosted Global Infrastructure**
- Rejected due to extremely high costs and complexity
- Significant operational overhead and expertise requirements
- Poor time-to-market for global deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Core Infrastructure** (Week 1-4)
   - Deploy edge locations in primary regions
   - Set up origin servers with load balancing
   - Implement basic caching and routing

2. **Advanced Caching** (Week 5-8)
   - Build cache invalidation system
   - Implement tag-based purging
   - Add content optimization features

3. **Global Optimization** (Week 9-12)
   - Deploy remaining edge locations
   - Implement cost optimization algorithms
   - Add security and DDoS protection

4. **Production Ready** (Week 13-16)
   - Performance monitoring and analytics
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Documentation and team training
