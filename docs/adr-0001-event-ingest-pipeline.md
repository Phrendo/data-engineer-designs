# ADR 0001: Event Ingestion Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Status:** proposed

## Context

We need to design a horizontally scalable pipeline capable of handling millions of events per second from various sources including web applications, mobile apps, IoT devices, and external APIs. The system must provide real-time processing capabilities, fault tolerance, and the ability to scale dynamically based on load.

Key requirements:
- Handle 5+ million events/second at peak load
- Sub-100ms processing latency (p99)
- Zero data loss with exactly-once processing semantics
- Support for multiple event sources and formats
- Real-time stream processing capabilities
- Long-term data archival and analytics

## Decision

We will implement an event ingestion pipeline using Apache Kafka as the core streaming platform, combined with Kafka Streams for real-time processing and a multi-tier storage architecture.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput event streaming with horizontal partitioning
- **Kafka Streams** for real-time event processing and aggregation
- **PostgreSQL** for transactional data and event metadata
- **Redis** for real-time caching and session storage
- **AWS S3** for long-term event archival and batch analytics

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Event sourcing for immutable event logs
- CQRS for separating read and write operations
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Dead letter queues for failed event handling

## Consequences

**Positive outcomes:**
- Horizontal scalability through Kafka partitioning
- High availability with multi-AZ deployment and replication
- Real-time processing capabilities with sub-100ms latency
- Exactly-once processing semantics preventing data duplication
- Flexible schema evolution through Schema Registry
- Cost-effective long-term storage with S3 archival

**Negative trade-offs:**
- Increased operational complexity with multiple components
- Higher infrastructure costs for multi-region deployment
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Kafka ecosystem
- Potential for increased latency during cross-region replication
- Complex monitoring and alerting requirements

## Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Amazon Kinesis + Lambda**
- Rejected due to vendor lock-in and higher costs at scale
- Limited control over partitioning and consumer group management
- Less flexibility for complex stream processing logic

**Option B: Apache Pulsar**
- Rejected due to smaller ecosystem and fewer operational tools
- Less mature compared to Kafka for high-throughput scenarios
- Limited team expertise and community support

**Option C: RabbitMQ + Custom Processing**
- Rejected due to lower throughput capabilities
- More complex to achieve horizontal scaling
- Less suitable for stream processing use cases

## Next Steps

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Week 1-2)
   - Deploy Kafka cluster with 12 brokers across 3 AZs
   - Configure Schema Registry for event schema management
   - Set up PostgreSQL cluster with read replicas

2. **Core Implementation** (Week 3-4)
   - Implement basic event producers and consumers
   - Develop Kafka Streams applications for real-time processing
   - Create monitoring and alerting infrastructure

3. **Performance Validation** (Week 5-6)
   - Load testing with target throughput (5M events/second)
   - Latency optimization and tuning
   - Failover and disaster recovery testing

4. **Production Deployment** (Week 7-8)
   - Gradual rollout with traffic ramping
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Documentation and team training
